# RecSys-final

This repository contains files relating to our final project for CSC 381 (Recommender Systems) at Davidson College. The recommender system is contained in recommendations.py. The file contains implementations for of 10 different algorithms: 1) user-based collaborative filtering using Euclidean distance for user-user similarity calculations (UU-CF-D), 2) user-based collaborative filtering using Pearson similarity (UU-CF-P), 3) item-based collaborative filtering using Euclidean distance (II-CF-D), 4) item-based collaborative filtering using Pearson similarity (II-CF-P), 5) matrix factorization collaborative filtering with stochastic gradient descent (MF-SGD), 6) matrix factorization collaborative filtering with alternating least squares (MF-ALS), 7) TFIDF content-based method with cosine similarity for content similarity calculations (TFIDF), 8) a hybrid model using a combination of the II-CF-D and TFIDF methods, (HYB-D) 9) a hybrid model using a combination of the II-CF-P and TFIDF methods (HYB-P) 10) and a neural collaborative filtering model (NCF). Intructions for running each of these models are below:
